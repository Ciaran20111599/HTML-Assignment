<h3>I love mythology</h3>

<p>I started loving mythology when I started reading the book series by Rick Riordan called Percy Jackson. 
It is about a 12 year old boy who discovers he is a child of Poseidon and has to go on a quest to save his mother and find Zeus's lightning bolt. 
From there many many books were made each revolving around a quest for that book but also the over arching story as well. 
This book series was what started my love of mythology, the stories behind them and the lessons in those stories. 
It was fun to learn about more mythologies other than Greek like the slightly different Roman pantheon, 
the Norse pantheon with Odin and Thor and the Egyptian pantheon of Ra and Set. 
Let me tell you 2 little stories that I know that you might find intresting or just show the lunacy of ancient myths.</p>

<br>

<p>I will start off with what got me intrested and what starts most peoples love of mythology, the greek pantheon.</p>

<p>There are numerous stories to choose from from Greek myth but I will try to choose one you havent heard of before, the crazy story of <span class="gods">Dionysus's</span> birth. </p>


<section>
<p id = "stories" ><span class="gods">Dionysus</span> was conceived by Zeus and a princess of Thebes named Semele who was said to be the most beautiful woman of her generation. 
Zeus and Semele had been having a secret affair for months, hiding from Zeus's wife Hera even after Semele fell very pregnant. 
Eventually however Hera did find out and while she could not punish Zeus or the princess directly she still had a plan. 
She appeared to the princess as her old childhood wet nurse and sowed doubt in her mind that her boyfriend wasnt actually the god Zeus and so told her to have him prove it 
to her by revealing his true godly form to him. Semele believed Hera and so when next Zeus came to visit she made him swear a holy oath
to fulfil whatever she requested as proof of their love and once he did she asked him to reveal his true form to her. 
Zeus told her it would kill her and asked her to request something else but it only made Semele more convicted to see his true form, 
and so when he relented and showed his true form to her she was instantly vaporized. However the baby was not. 
Seeing this Zeus knew that this baby had the chance to be a god and if not then at least a demigod, 
however it was still far to young and needed a few more months to develop. So Zeus did the only natural thing a god would do in this situation, 
he took his lightning bold, cut his thigh open and stuck the baby inside to allow it to grow inside his leg. 
The following months Zeus kept the child in his thigh until it felt ready to be released and born into the world. 
He then entrusted him to Hermes to bring to Semele's sister Ino and tell them to dress him as a girl to hide him from Hera's wrath. 
They did so and raised him as a girl in public and a boy in private confusing him but keeping him safe from hera for a few years until she finally did find them, however that is a diffrent story. 
(<span class="gods">Dionysus</span> later went on to be the god of anyone confused about their own gender because of this).</p>

<section>
<p>Greek mythology always is somewhat mad, but let us step away from the greeks to talk about the Norse Pantheon. 
The Norse Pantheon is second only to the Greeks for popularity, its stories of the 9 realms and ragnarok have inspired many games, movies and stories. 
So let us look at where all that insiration began and look to the Murder of <span class="gods">Baldur</span>, the most beloved god.</p>
</section>


<section>
<p id = "stories"><span class="gods">Baldur</span> was the son of <span class="gods">Odin</span> and <span class="gods">Freya</span>, he was the most beloved being in all of Asgard the realm of the Aseir gods. 
But his mother <span class="gods">Freya</span> feared a prophecy, Ragnarok. 
It was said that before Ragnarok begins <span class="gods">Baldur</span> would die as his death marks the begin of Fimbulwinter the 3 year long winter before Ragnarok began. 
In an attempt to defy fate <span class="gods">Freya</span> visited each and every living thing in the realms, every animal, every mountain, 
embodiment of winds and blades all to ask them to swear never to do harm to her son <span class="gods">Baldur</span>. 
All agreed to never do him harm as all loved <span class="gods">Baldur</span> dearly. 
And so with her mission achieved <span class="gods">Freya</span> returned home to inform her son of the good news 
and a feast was held to celebrate <span class="gods">Baldurs</span> newly found invincibility. 
All the gods came to celebrate, throwing and attacking <span class="gods">Baldur</span> with everything they had to test his invincibility, 
but one god was not so pleased at this new gift <span class="gods">Baldur</span> had received, <span class="gods">Loki</span>.

<span class="gods">Loki</span> decided that he would find someway to kill <span class="gods">Baldur</span> and went to search the realms for something <span class="gods">Freya</span> had missed. 
As he wondered the woods he happened upon a small mistletoe weed and asked if it had made a deal with,  
but <span class="gods">Freya</span> had forgotten about the small weed in her quest. 
<span class="gods">Loki</span> immediately gathered some mistletoe and formed it into an arrow and returned to the party. 
There he found <span class="gods">Baldurs</span> brother, <span class="gods">Hodur</span>, a blind and weaponless god who had been left out of the festivities by all. 
<span class="gods">Loki</span> disguised himself and approached <span class="gods">Hodur</span> and asked if he would like some help so that he could partake in the fun with everyone else. 
<span class="gods">Hodur</span> agreed and with a disguised <span class="gods">Loki's</span> help knocked and fired the mistletoe arrow into his brothers chest killing his own brother. </p>
