<section>
<p>My name is <b>Ciaran Caffrey</b>, I am 20 years old and was born on the 28th of September, 2004.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>I enjoy a few different hobbies including D&D, Video Games and Mythology. 
I'll be making a few small web pages to cover a each of these points individually.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>My family consists of my mom, my nana and grandad, 
two uncles and five cousins on my moms side and my dad, my nanny and grandad and my three brothers on my dads side. 
I am very close with both my grandparents and have many great memories with them and visited them regularly when I was younger.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>I live with my mom and we are very close. We enjoy watching crime shows together such as NCIS, Person of Interest and White Collar 
and have watched many entire series together to the point of nearly running out of shows to watch. 
I am not close with my dad sadly but my mom more than makes up for that and she has been very good for me and has done a great job raising me 
and looking after me and I have had a very fun and laughter filled childhood.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p>Finally for my little social circle I have a girlfriend called Pippa. 
She is a beautiful woman with gorgeous long hair who I love very much. 
She lives on the Isle of Man at a Boyles sports betting shop and used to live in Germany 
for roughly 5 years though she is originally from Britain and grew up there.</p>
