<h1><center><b>Why I love D&D</b></h1><br>

<main>

<h4>As stated previously I love dnd and it is a very fun and important hobby for me as I have met many friends through it and even met my girlfriend through dnd. 
I find it very fun because as a player it is like a strategy game, 
where I can come up with plans with my party and the only limitations are what the game master will allow and our imaginations. 
I also love the story telling and role play side of it as a game master and a player, 
being able to discover and tell a story with my friends where even the game master doesn't fully know how it will go 
because of player choices is wonderful and always leads to surprises and twists.</h4>

<h4>I love to play as spellcasters as I love the wide array of options magic gives me and knowing that I will nearly always have something I can do to help in any situation, 
whether it is a fight or a social encounter or a dangerous moat of lava we need to cross. My three favourite classes are:</h4>

<li><img border="3px" src="Images/Warlock bg.png" alt="Warlock" width="150" height="150"></li>
<li><img border="3px" src="Images/Artificer bg.png" alt="Artificer" width="150" height="150"></li>
</ol>



<h4>I love clerics because they let me swap out my spells regularly when needed and there are always very powerful and important to the party. 
However the main reason I love them is because I love mythology and gods, so being able to include them with my character and make them an important part of their backstory and self is enjoyable to me. 
I love choosing a god to worship and then thinking what kind of character would worship that god, 
like for instance I have a cleric who worships a god of peace and so he is a more gentle and 
innocent person who while not afraid to get his hands dirty would always prefer to find a peaceful solution if there is one. </h4>

<h4>Secondly I love warlocks for very similar reasons as clerics, 
because warlocks get their magic from making a deal with a powerful entity like a fey or a devil or an eldritch horror that instantly makes for an intresting and fun plot hook to explore with that character. 
Who is their patron, why did they make the deal with the character, what deal did they make for this power? All these questions can lead to amazing characters and stories for the player and the party as a whole. 
I had a warlock character whos father was their patron. 
Their father was a greedy genie who gave magic to me his son so I could gather riches and treasure to add to his riches, 
but my game master dropped a bombshell when I ran into a sibling of my characters who revealed that this was what the genie did, 
he fathered mortal children to gather him riches and it made for an amazing twist. </h4>

<h4>Finally there are artificers who are like the magical mechanics of dnd. Artificers are capable of creating magical items and enchantments to boost their own and their parties power. 
They have spells that are useful outside of combat as if they have their own toolbox of spells to get them out of jams and sticky situations. 
Also who doesn't want to just pull out a gun in this magical wonderland fantasy world and shoot a dragon in the face. 
An artificer I have made and look forward to playing is a genius inventor who plans to build the greatest suit of armour the world has ever seen, 
so good in fact he hopes to challenge a god to a fight to show that through hard work and effort mortals can reach the level of the gods. </h4>
